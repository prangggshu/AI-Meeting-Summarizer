# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements an AI-powered meeting notes summarizer and sharing application. The system allows users to upload text transcripts, provide custom summarization instructions, generate AI-powered summaries, edit the results, and share them via email. The application focuses on functionality over design, providing a streamlined workflow for processing and distributing meeting summaries.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a meeting participant, I want to upload text transcripts of meetings, so that I can process them for summarization.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the application THEN the system SHALL display a file upload interface for text files
2. WHEN a user selects a text file THEN the system SHALL validate that the file is a supported text format
3. WHEN a valid text file is uploaded THEN the system SHALL display the transcript content in a preview area
4. IF the uploaded file is not a valid text format THEN the system SHALL display an error message and reject the upload
5. WHEN the transcript is successfully loaded THEN the system SHALL enable the next step in the workflow

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to provide custom instructions for summarization, so that I can get summaries tailored to my specific needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a transcript is loaded THEN the system SHALL display a text input field for custom instructions
2. WHEN a user enters custom instructions THEN the system SHALL accept and store the instruction text
3. WHEN no custom instruction is provided THEN the system SHALL use a default summarization prompt
4. WHEN custom instructions are provided THEN the system SHALL validate that the instructions are not empty
5. WHEN instructions exceed reasonable length limits THEN the system SHALL display a warning about potential processing issues

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to generate AI-powered summaries of my transcripts, so that I can quickly extract key information from lengthy meeting notes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks "Generate Summary" THEN the system SHALL send the transcript and instructions to an AI service
2. WHEN the AI processing is in progress THEN the system SHALL display a loading indicator
3. WHEN the AI successfully generates a summary THEN the system SHALL display the structured summary to the user
4. IF the AI service fails or is unavailable THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message
5. WHEN the summary is generated THEN the system SHALL enable editing functionality for the summary

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to edit the generated summary, so that I can refine and customize the content before sharing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a summary is generated THEN the system SHALL display the summary in an editable text area
2. WHEN a user makes changes to the summary THEN the system SHALL save the changes in real-time or on user action
3. WHEN editing the summary THEN the system SHALL preserve formatting and structure
4. WHEN the user finishes editing THEN the system SHALL enable the sharing functionality
5. WHEN the summary is being edited THEN the system SHALL provide basic text editing capabilities

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want to share summaries via email, so that I can distribute meeting outcomes to relevant stakeholders.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a summary is ready for sharing THEN the system SHALL display an email sharing interface
2. WHEN a user enters recipient email addresses THEN the system SHALL validate the email format
3. WHEN valid email addresses are provided THEN the system SHALL enable the send functionality
4. WHEN a user clicks send THEN the system SHALL compose and send an email with the summary content
5. IF email sending fails THEN the system SHALL display an error message and allow retry
6. WHEN the email is successfully sent THEN the system SHALL display a confirmation message

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to be deployed and accessible online, so that I can use it from anywhere without local installation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application is deployed THEN it SHALL be accessible via a public URL
2. WHEN a user accesses the deployed application THEN all core functionality SHALL work as specified
3. WHEN the application is running THEN it SHALL handle multiple concurrent users appropriately
4. WHEN the application encounters errors THEN it SHALL provide meaningful feedback to users
5. WHEN the application is accessed THEN it SHALL load within reasonable time limits

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive documentation of the approach and tech stack, so that the implementation decisions and process are clearly understood.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the project is completed THEN there SHALL be documentation detailing the technical approach
2. WHEN reviewing the documentation THEN it SHALL include the chosen tech stack with justifications
3. WHEN examining the process documentation THEN it SHALL outline the development methodology used
4. WHEN the documentation is provided THEN it SHALL include deployment instructions and architecture decisions
5. WHEN technical decisions are documented THEN they SHALL include rationale for AI service selection and integration approach
