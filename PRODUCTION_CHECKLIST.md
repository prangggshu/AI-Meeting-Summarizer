npm run deploy:validate

# Deploy to staging first (recommended)
npm run deploy:staging

# Deploy to production
npm run deploy:production
```

### 2. Verify Deployment
```bash
# Run automated verification
npm run verify:deployment https://your-app-name.vercel.app

# Check health endpoint manually
curl https://your-app-name.vercel.app/health
```

### 3. Test Complete Workflow
